# `word-games-tui`

`word-games-tui` is a terminal implementation of several popular word games for the command line. It is designed to be highly portable (i.e. to run on any version of Python 3 without dependencies) and friendly to small screens (specifically the terminal emulator on my Blackberry Classic.)

Currently implemented:
* Wordle
* Connections
